        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello!! I'm Emily Tran, a computer science student at Cal Poly Pomona and a passionate self-taught game developer. I specialize in creating 2D narrative-driven adventure games in Unity, utilizing my art and animation to bring these games to life. I enjoy both team and solo projects. I love environments where everyone can socialize, collaborate, learn, and have fun together doing what we love. My independent projects allow me to explore new things and grow at my own pace. Although I have my areas of focus, I'm always interested in learning new things and meeting new people! Feel free to check out my projects below!  </p>

                    <h4>Booping Beep – 2D Endless Runner</h4>
                    <p>Created in a 75-hour time limit for a game jam, Booping Beep is a fast-paced 2D endless runner, heavily inspired by Jetpack Joyride. Players control a bee named Beep, where they dodge through endless obstacles and collect power-ups.  </p>
                    <p>In our team of four, my main contributions were creating and animating the character sprites, power-ups, and integrating these animations smoothly into Unity. Being the art lead, I oversaw all the art done and provided direction and assistance for the team. Additionally, I helped with debugging projectiles and power-up interactivity. </p>
                    <p>We were able to showcase Booping Beep to an open audience, where players tested the game and provided encouraging feedback that helped us refine our ideas further and keep developing! Images/Gifs of my work are available on this page.</p>

                    <h4>Sntruggled – VR FPS Zombie Survival</h4>
                    <p>Sntruggled (a play of words on snuggled and struggled) is a VR FPS zombie survival game, inspired by Call Of Duty: Zombies, developed for a research VR Lab at Cal Poly Pomona. Over the couse of four months, my team of four created an immersive VR experience where players explore an environment while fending off quirky, cat-like enemies.</p>
                    <p>My main contributions included implementing player movement with the XR Toolkit, integrating enemy animations, implementing enemy AI, and adding 3D spatial audio for immersion within Unity. We collaborated weekly to review progress and to receive guidance from our mentors.</p>
                    <p>We showcased Sntruggled to an open audience, where players tested the game and provided valuable feedback that improved our final version. The presentation was a great opportunity to engage with the audience and share our development process. A demo video of Sntruggled is available on this page. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2cnyOMvNU2k" target="_blank">Video also linked here.</a></p>

                    <h4>The Adventure of Hammy – 2D Narrative Adventure (in progress)</h4>
                    <p>The Adventure of Hammy is an independently developed 2D narrative adventure game exploring long-distance relationships. Players navigate an action-filled environment that represents long-distance relationships through narrative and environmental storytelling.</p>
                    <p>I have implemented core gameplay mechanics in Unity using C#, including player movement, directional attacks, and health/stamina/healing systems. I have also created and animated sprites for these mechanics, ensuring clear visual feedback for the player.</p>
                    <p>The Adventure of Hammy is a work in progress, with additional mechanics and a branching dialogue system currently in development. A preview video of the project is available on this page.</p>

                    <p>Fitch is a 2D Metroidvania-style story adventure game. Players control a witch navigating diverse environments, battling enemies, and using a fox companion that grants special powers.</p>
                    <p>This project is in early development as an independent game. I developed mini-prototypes to experiment with player movement and art style. I finalized the art style and fully rendered the main protagonist with basic animations. Prototype videos and character sprites can be viewed on this page. </p>
                    <p>I am currently developing the narrative and additional characters for the game.</p>

                    <p>Elementail is a rogue-lite, elemental-based 2D action platformer where players control a cat named Sesame, navigating levels and battling enemies. As players progress, they unlock elemental abilities that change their playstyle, preparing them for platforming challenges and boss fights.</p>
                    <p>The project is currently on hiatus. My contributions include designing and animating the main character sprite in Aseprite and integrating it into Unity. I also serve as art lead in a team of four, providing visual direction and support for the team. The sprite work I created is showcased on this page</p>
                    <p>Future work includes reworking mechanics, cleaning up code, and developing enemy sprites.</p>
