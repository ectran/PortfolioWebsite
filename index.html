        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello!! I'm Emily Tran, a computer science student at Cal Poly Pomona and a passionate self-taught game developer. I specialize in creating 2D games with narrative-driven adventure games in Unity, utilizing my art and animation to bring these games to life. I enjoy both team and solo projects. I love environments where everyone can socialize, collaborate, learn, and have fun together doing what we love. My independent projects allow me to explore new things and grow at my own pace. Although I have my areas of focus, I'm always interested in learning new things and meeting new people! Feel free to check out my projects below!  </p>

                    <h4>Booping Beep</h4>
                    <p>Fitch is a 2D Metroidvania-style story adventure game where you play as a witch navigating through diverse environments, battling enemies, and utilizing the help of a fox companion that grants special powers. </p>
                    <p>This game is currently in early development as an independent passion project using Unity for game development and Aseprite for creating pixel art and animations. Here’s a sneak peak of the main characters design and idle animation.</p>

                    <h4>Elementail (In Progress)</h4>
                    <p>Elementail is a rogue-lite elemental-based 2D action platformer game where you play as a cat navigating through various levels and battling enemies. As the player progresses, they unlock different elemental abilities that change their playstyle, helping them prepare for platforming challenges and intense boss fights of varying difficulties. </p>
                    <p>The game is currently in early development as part of a collaborative project with a team of friends. We’re using Unity for game development and Aseprite for creating pixel art and animations. Here’s a sneak peak of the main characters design and idle animation that I've worked on. </p>

                    <h4>Sntruggled (In Progress)</h4>
                    <p>Sntruggled is a VR first-person shooter (FPS) zombie survival game where you and your stuffed animal friends fight off endless waves of toys. Use a variety of toy gun weapons, each with unique features, to decimate your enemies in this immersive VR experience. </p>
                    <p>The game is currently in early development as part of a collaborative project with a team of friends. We’re using Unity for game development, Unity’s free assets for 3D models and animations, and Blender for customization. Although there isn’t much to show yet, I am actively involved in the controller movement, enemy AI, and overall game design. </p>
